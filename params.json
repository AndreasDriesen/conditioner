{"name":"Conditioner","tagline":"JavaScript Conditioner framework","body":"JavaScript Conditioner Framework\r\n================================\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nConditioner is a JavaScript framework to help you decouple your JavaScript UI classes from your HTML and allows you to only initialize them under on certain conditions (which is a good thing).\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nIn short it allows you to do the following:\r\nLoad the Clock behavior the moment the supplied media query is met.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div data-behavior=\"ui.Clock\" data-conditions='{\"media\":\"(max-width:40em)\"}'>\r\n    ui.Clock is inactive\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar myConditioner = Conditioner.getInstance();\r\n    myConditoiner.applyBehavior(document);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nMost UI Classes should not be concerned with the conditions under which they are allowed to be active.\r\n\r\nFor instance you might have a Map Class which generates a detailed map based on the current geolocation. Maybe, because the map takes up a lot of space, on a small screen you would rather show a url to a map service instead. The moment you add all the screen size tests to the Map Class the Map Class becomes a lot less flexible.\r\n\r\nBy separating the conditions under which the Map Class becomes active you can reuse the Class under various circumstances without altering it's code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
